This website is to introduce Wushu and some of the traditional routines being learned during CCA. The target audience is for those who are interested in Wushu and wants to join Ngee Ann Wushu CCA. It can also be for people who just wants to get to know what Wushu is, especially for people who have deep Chinese cultural interest. Through this website, both Wushu practitioners and non-Wushu practitioners will cultivate a deeper appreciation for Wushu thanks to its dual element of sport and culture.

As the owner of this site, and a member in Wushu, I aim for more people to join and be active in our CCA.

In the index.html, users will be brought to the home page, where there is a slide show of Ngee Ann's Wushu member. This slideshow is created so that users can look at our group photos, achievements and bonding sessions as a way to introduce Wushu to users. It is automatic, so users does not have to manually click them.

As they scroll down, there will be 4 routines that are being displayed. When user clicks onto each of them, they will be brought to one of Wushu's routine page on a new tab. In this page, details, pictures and videos will be showcased for users to get a better understanding of what the traditional routine, for example Southern fist routine, will be like. There will be only 5 pages including the home page, with each page displaying the respective routines information.

When user continues to scroll down the home page, there will be a small introduction on what Wushu is about. A form is attached below such that interested individuals would sign up Wushu as a CCA in Ngee Ann Poly.

Finally towards the end, the Ngee Ann Wushu instagram page is provided such that users can click onto it for a better view of how trainings are like, as well as get to know the exco member in Wushu.
